/**
 * @@sandvik modified
 * The AccessibleObject class is the base class for Field, Method and
 * Constructor objects.  It provides the ability to flag a reflected
 * object as suppressing default Java language access control checks
 * when it is used.  The access checks--for public, default (package)
 * access, protected, and private members--are performed when Fields,
 * Methods or Constructors are used to set or get fields, to invoke
 * methods, or to create and initialize new instances of classes,
 * respectively.
 *
 * <p>Setting the {@code accessible} flag in a reflected object
 * permits sophisticated applications with sufficient privilege, such
 * as Java Object Serialization or other persistence mechanisms, to
 * manipulate objects in a manner that would normally be prohibited.
 *
 * <p>By default, a reflected object is <em>not</em> accessible.
